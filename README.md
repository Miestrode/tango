## About The Project
Tango is a performant, free, and open-source Minecraft name sniper.

This project's aim is to provide a fast, free, open-source, and trusted alternative to proprietery name snipers. It's aimed at users from all skill levels. Beginners or veterans.

### Minecraft name sniping
When you change your username in Minecraft, other players can claim the old username after 37 days. Trying to be the first to claim the old username is called name sniping
### Proprietery name snipers
Currently, most name snipers are proprietery. Because of that they may use your data maliciously.
Most of them are also paid, cannot be learned from, and don't accept contributions.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

First install Python 3.9 from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-395).

Then go to your terminal of choice.
If you're using Windows, type:
```
py -m pip install aiohttp
py -m pip install colorama
```

instead, if you're using Unix/macOS, type:
```
python3 -m pip install aiohttp
py -m pip install colorama
```

### Installation
You can download the project by going to [here](https://github.com/Miestrode/tango) and clicking the green button with the `code` label.
Then just install the ZIP.

### Usage
You can start using Tango by following these steps:
* Open the `src` folder
* Run `main.py`

`build_json.py` Creates your configuration file for the first time, but it can be used again.
`main.py` Uses `sniper.py` to run a sniping session with the data from your configuration file.
It is advised to have a configuration file before running `main.py`, although you don't have to.
