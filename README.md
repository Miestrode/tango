## About The Project
Tango is an asynchornous open-source minecraft name sniper written in Python.

This project's aim is to provide a fast, free, open-source, and trusted alternative to proprietery name snipers.
The project can be used by both beginners or advanced users. It is OS independent.

### Minecraft name sniping
When you change your username in Minecraft, other players can claim the old username after 37 days. Trying to be the first to claim the old username is called name sniping.

### Proprietery name snipers
Currently, most name snipers are proprietery. This means that they may use your data (Email and password) maliciously, and they are also paid.

## Getting Started

Then, if you're using Windows:
```

```

instaed, if you're using Unix/macOS:
```

```
